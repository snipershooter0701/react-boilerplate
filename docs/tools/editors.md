# Setting Up Your Editor

You can edit React Boilerplate using any editor or IDE, but there are a few extra steps that you can take to make sure your coding experience is as good as it can be.

## VS Code

We provide `.vscode` folder out of the box which includes the **recommend extensions** and **debugger configuration** and **settings**

They are highly suggested for better the Developer Experience. Extensions are responsible for:

- Eslint
- Prettier
- Chrome debugger
- Jest
- Styled Components

which are the basic building blocks in the boilerplate.
