# Setting Up Your Editor

You can edit React Boilerplate using any editor or IDE, but there are a few extra steps that you can take to make sure your coding experience is as good as it can be.

## VS Code

We provide `.vscode` folder out of the box which includes the **recommend extensions** and **debugger configuration** and **settings**

They are highly suggested for the better the Developer Experience. Extensions are responsible for:

- Eslint
- Prettier
- Chrome debugger
- Jest
- Styled Components

which are the basic building blocks in the boilerplate.

## Chrome Extensions

For a better debugging and development experience we suggest [Redux DevTools](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/redux-devtools/lmhkpmbekcpmknklioeibfkpmmfibljd?hl=en). In the boilerplate redux is configured according to it so that you can debug and monitor your state changes very easily.
