# React Boilerplate CRA Template

## What is React Boilerplate CRA Template

{% hint style="info" %}

üíÅ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è **TL;DR:** **`CRA`** handles the bootstrapping and **`React Boilerplate`** gets you started with the best tools and practices.

{% endhint %}

This is a custom [create-react-app] template of [react-boilerplate]. React Boilerplate has been developing the ultimate react starter kit for many years now. On the other hand **`CRA`**(create-react-app) is currently the people's favourite choice. This template has been created to join their strengths together. **`CRA`** provides the necessary bootstrapping to start your projects but does not provide a guide on how to built it. That is where **react-boilerplate** comes in and prepares the bases with the battle-tested techniques and tools to guide you into creating state-of-the-art web applications.

{% hint style="warning" %}

This documentation assumes that you are familiar with the [create-react-app]. The template is built on top of it ;)
